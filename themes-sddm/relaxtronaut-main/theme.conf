[General]

Background="Relaxtronaut.png"
## Must match the name of the image in the theme directory. Any standard image file format is allowed with transparency supported. (e.g. background.jpeg/illustration.GIF/Foto.png)

ScaleMethod = "Stretch"
## The scaling method for the image. Possible values: "PreserveAspectCrop": Crop the image to fit the item's dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio. "PreserveAspectFit": Fit the entire image into the item's dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio. "Stretch": Stretch the image to fill the item's dimensions, potentially distorting the aspect ratio.


ScreenWidth=2560
ScreenHeight=1080
## Adjust to your resolution to help SDDM speed up on calculations

## [Blur Settings]

FullBlur="false"
PartialBlur="true"
## Enable or disable the blur effect; if HaveFormBackground is set to true then PartialBlur will trigger the BackgroundColor of the form element to be partially transparent and blend with the blur.

BlurRadius="80"
## Set the strength of the blur effect. Anything above 100 is pretty strong and might slow down the rendering time. 0 is like setting false for any blur.

## [Design Customizations]

MainColor="#dfd9fc"
## Used for all elements when not focused/hovered etc. Usually the best effect is achieved by having this either white or a very light color

AccentColor="#edeaf9"
## Used for elements in focus/hover/pressed. Should be contrasting to the background and the MainColor for best effect

BackgroundColor="#404048"
## Used for the user and session selection background as well as for ScreenPadding and FormBackground when either is true. If PartialBlur and FormBackground are both enabled this color will blend with the blur effect.

InterfaceShadowSize="4"
## Integer used as multiplier. Size of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background. Initial render can be slow no values above 5-7.

InterfaceShadowOpacity="0.7"
## Double between 0 and 1. Alpha channel of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background.


RoundCorners=4
## Radius of the input fields and the login button. Empty for square. Can cause bad antialiasing of the fields.

ScreenPadding=0
## Increase or delete this to have a white padding all around your screen. This makes your image appear like a canvas. Cool!

Font="Noto Sans"
## If you want to choose a custom font it will have to be available to the X root user. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fonts#Manual_installation

FontSize=
## Only set a fixed value if fonts are way too small for your resolution. Preferrably kept empty.



## [Locale Settings]

Locale=
## The time and date locale should usually be set in your system settings. Only hard set this if something is not working by default or you want a seperate locale setting in your login screen.

HourFormat="hh:mm"
## Defaults to Locale.ShortFormat. Accepts "long" or a custom string like "hh:mm A". See http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html

DateFormat="dddd, d of MMMM"
## Defaults to Locale.LongFormat. Accepts "short" or a custom string like "dddd, d 'of' MMMM". See http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html



## [Interface Behavior]

ForceRightToLeft=false
## Revert the layout either because you would like the login to be on the right hand side or SDDM won't respect your language locale for some reason.

ForceLastUser=true
## Have the last user appear automatically in the username field.

ForcePasswordFocus=true
## Give automatic focus to the password field. Together with ForceLastUser this makes for the fastest login experience. 

ForceHideCompletePassword=false
## If you don't like to see any character at all not even while being entered set this to true.

ForceHideVirtualKeyboardButton="false"
## Do not show the button for the virtual keyboard at all. This will completely disable functionality for the virtual keyboard even if it is installed and activated in sddm.conf


## [Translations]

## SDDM may lack proper translation for every element. Suger defaults to SDDM translations. Please help translate SDDM as much as possible for your language: https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/Localization. These are in order as they appear on screen.

HeaderText=Â¡Bienvenido!
## Header can be empty to not display any greeting at all. Keep it short.
